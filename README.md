Using CodeInstitute Template for README.md - ongoing 

User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project

This project is revolves around building a static frontend only website for a band called the Monkeys, the knowledge I learned during the early part of this course 
will be used to create a user friendly website. I will focus on the advise given and only develope outside of it really makes sense.

The commit on this was dont after editing on Orionhub.org

The front end html design was based on an older more relaxed format as the users of any Monkees site would be of a generation


I used the wireframe for the inital design structure (added to git (wireframes)


The site is basic with a landing page, then links to TV shows (embedded youtube) a Wiki songs list, contact information page and a question to win a prize. 

Users should able to look at TV shows (again embedded) contact the band or link to Social media

Nearly all of the features on this project were put in because of previous lessons on Codeinstitute course.

This site could easily be made better but I dont have the knowledge yet


JQuery - there was a mention of using this but there was no training provided? was this to be added? 

<!--Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.-->

<!--For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:-->

<!--Contact form:-->
<!--Go to the "Contact Us" page-->
<!--Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears-->
<!--Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears-->
<!--Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.-->
<!--In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.-->

<!--You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.-->

<!--If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.-->

<!--Deployment-->
<!--This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).-->

<!--In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:-->

<!--Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?-->
<!--Different configuration files?-->
<!--Separate git branch?-->
<!--In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.-->
